# Airbnb Clone Project

This project is a backend clone of Airbnb, designed to practice building a real-world booking platform.  
The goal is to build a scalable backend using Django, with features like property listings, user management, bookings, and reviews.
## Technology Stack

- **Django:** Web framework used to build the backend APIs.  
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL:** Database system to store users, properties, and bookings.  
- **GraphQL:** (Optional) API query language for efficient data fetching.  
- **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.  
- **GitHub Actions:** Tool to automate testing and deployment pipelines.
## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic, database models, and API endpoints.
- **Database Administrator:** Designs, manages, and optimizes the database, ensuring data integrity and performance.
- **Frontend Developer:** (If applicable) Works on the user interface and experience, integrating with the backend APIs.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Manages deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure to ensure smooth and automated releases.
- **QA Engineer:** Tests the application manually and/or automatically to ensure it works correctly and securely.
## Database Design

The main entities in the database include:

- **Users:** Stores information about users such as username, email, password, and contact details.
- **Properties:** Details about listed properties including title, description, location, price, and availability.
- **Bookings:** Records bookings made by users with start date, end date, total price, and status.
- **Reviews:** Feedback left by users on properties, including rating and comments.
- **Payments:** Information about payment transactions including amount, payment method, and status.

Relationships:
- A user can list multiple properties.
- A booking is linked to one property and one user.
- A user can leave multiple reviews, each linked to a property.
- Payments are linked to bookings.
## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:** Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
- **Property Management:** Hosts can list properties by providing details such as title, description, price, and availability.
- **Booking System:** Users can search for available properties and make bookings with selected dates.
- **Review System:** Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure handling of payments related to bookings, including transaction history.
## API Security

To ensure the safety of user data and secure backend operations, the following security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication:** Only registered users can access certain endpoints. We'll use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization:** Access control based on user roles (e.g., only hosts can list properties, only users who booked can leave a review).
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against abuse by limiting how many requests a user can make within a time frame.
- **Data Validation & Sanitization:** Prevents malicious data from entering the system by checking and cleaning inputs.
- **Secure Payment Handling:** Sensitive payment details are never stored; instead, we use a third-party processor (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).

These measures are critical to protect user information, ensure trust, and comply with modern security standards.
## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code, making development faster and more reliable.

For this project, we plan to use:

- **GitHub Actions:** To automatically run tests and checks whenever code is pushed to the repository.
- **Docker:** To containerize the application for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Heroku or Render (Optional):** For hosting and deploying the application li
